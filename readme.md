# ABIKA (à¤…à¤­à¤¿à¤•à¤¾)
## Ambient Behavioral Intelligence with Knowledge Analysis

ABIKA is an intelligent Linux assistant designed to understand and predict user behavior through silent observation and pattern recognition. It employs a unique dual-realm architecture for optimal performance and functionality.
